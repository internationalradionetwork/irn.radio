  This page is intended to provide you with detailed information about the IRN, including details on how to set up devices, how to access the system, nets, registration and more.  If you need further information, please <a href="contact.html">contact us</a>, and we will reply promptly.

  <h4><b><i>Talk rights and trusted status - what do I need to do?</i></b></h4>
  <p>
  <ul>
  <li>When you first log in to the IRN on a Zello channel, only a moderator will be able to hear you. If you identify, and ask for help, the moderator will be able to check the member database and "trust" you into the channel so that everyone can hear you. You must do this for Zello channel you connect to.</li>
  <li>  When you first log in using Teamspeak, you will enter the ‘Welcome Channel’, where an Admin or Moderator will allocate you with a level of ‘talk-rights’, depending on your license status. This means that you will have access to the appropriate channels, depending on whether or not you are licensed.</li>
  <li>Once granted, talk rights are permanent, but can be revoked in the case of inappropriate use of the system.</li>
  <li>Our moderators are all volunteers, and do not monitor all the time. The best time to catch a moderator is just prior to a scheduled net. Try calling five to ten minutes prior to a net, and a moderator should be available to help you.</li>
