  <p>	
The International Radio Network (IRN) will process personal information, which includes names, callsigns and email addresses, to facilitate and support the use of the IRN by new and existing members. All member data is held in a secure electronic database, and members may request that personal details are updated or removed at any time.
</p>
<p>
Personal information is used by IRN administrators and moderators, to enable talk rights, to grant permissions and to provide other support to members as required.  The IRN uses a third-party provider, Jotform, to forward information from the IRN website to our administrators. Jotform shares our focus on privacy, and you may read their privacy policy <a href="https://www.jotform.com/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.  If a member or prospective member does not wish to use the form provided by Jotform, the IRN offers contact options using traditional email.  Contact options are clearly outlined on both the new member registration page, and the contact page.

<p>
Personal information is used only for the stated reasons.  Except as noted above, the IRN does not share the personal information of our members, nor does it send unsolicited email to anyone.
